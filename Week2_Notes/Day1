# Week 2 Day 1

## Probability

### Objectives
- Review probability definitions and concepts
- Review combinatorics definitions and concepts
- Review probability definitions
- Understand which distributions to use to model which processes

### Definitions
-
    - P(Aand B) = 0
- Probablity Measure

- the expected value of a probability distribution is really just a weighted average

# Sets
Sample Space - the set of all outcomes of a random experiment
- Event Space - a set of elements (events) which are subsets of the larger sample space
- Disjoint Events - two events whose probability of occurring at the same time is 0
- $\cup$ = union, P(A $\cup$ B) is the probability of A **OR** B
- $\cap$ = intersection, P(A $\cap$ B) is the probability of A **AND** B
- $\in$ = element in, a $\in$ A is element a in the set A
- Complement: $A^c$ = $\{x: x \notin A\}$ the elements of x where x is not in A
- ':' = 'such that'

# Combinatorics

\[{n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}\]

# Probability
- data is random, we need to be able to model randomness
- Frequentist - how likely an event is given probability
- Bayesian - how likely our beliefs are to be correct given a probability
- enumeration of all possible outcomees is not a terrible idea to get a sense of probability of something

# Distributions

- **Variance** - The variance of a random variable X is a measure of how concentrated the distribution of a random variable X is around its mean.
- **Geometric** - no no no no no no no yes
- **Poisson** - # number of events in a period of time
- **chi-squared** - the sum of the squares of many normally distributed distributions

**Correlation** is a hint but is no guarantee of a relationship or lack-thereof


#### Properties of distributions
- expectation/mean
- kurtosis - tells you if you have fat tails on your distribution (ex. T-dist)
- skew - measures the asymmetry of a distribution
- variance/std
- correlation

### Warning, numpy!
- numpy defaults to population equations, not sample values, so be careful and check the manual to make sure that the degrees of freedom and things are all consistent
